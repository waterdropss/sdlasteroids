# What is SDL Asteroids? #

SDL Asteroids is a highly enhanced, SDL-based, Open Source implementation of the classic game of Asteroids that runs on both Windows and Linux. Binaries for both systems are included in the archive, and they both use the same data files. It is currently still in the process of development, but is already very playable, with a basic menu interface and an infinite number of levels. It is designed to be highly modular, with essentially every feature able to be customized (mostly from the source code, not from the actual program yet). It also aims to be highly realistic, with vector-based object motion, (relatively) accurate gravitational pull, and other advanced features.

### NEWS ###

**11/07/09**
After a major bugfix release (a long time in coming), I am ceasing development on this project indefinitely. Anyone who wants to can try and interpret my horribly organized code and make it better, but otherwise, this is probably the last release for at least the next two years.

**03/31/09**
Please note that I fixed the major memory leaks that plagued the last few releases, and although there are a few leaks still present in the code, they are comparatively minor. If you are still using version 0.7.2 or older, please make sure you download the latest version from the downloads page.
